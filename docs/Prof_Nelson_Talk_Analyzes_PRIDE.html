		Analyzes P.R.I.D.E.</h3>
		<p><br>
		by Lauren Wedeles '66<br>
		<br>
		In a lecture last Wednesday entitled "Computers, Creativity and the 
Nature of the Written Word," Theodor Nelson of the sociology department 
challenged the public to be receptive to new uses of computers, or, as 
he prefers to call them, "general purpose machines." The talk was 
anecdotal and humorous at times, but with an underlying seriousness and 
enthusiasm throughout.<br>
		<br>
		Mr. Nelson described the constant improvements in size, cost, and 
speed of the machines. He explained some of the mechanics of the 
machines, which operate on patterns of sparks that conceivably can 
initiate a set of functions.<br>
		<br>
		The languages of the computer, called macro-languages, are only limited in usefulness by the in<br>

		genuity of the programmer. Programs can include words, pictures, 
printing, or strings of words. A cathode-ray display can be hooked to 
the computer and can present a visual picture of the programmed 
material.<br>
		<br>
		The potential use of the computer in the creative process was the most
 important aspect of Mr. Nelson's lecture, particularly emphasizing the 
possibilities for the humanities. Using a personal anecdote, he reminded
 the audience of the problems of organizing material into a coherent 
piece of writing. As a new organization method Mr. Nelson has invented 
the PRIDE (Personalized Retrieval Indexing and Documentary Evolution) 
system.<br>
		<br>
		In this system passages of material would be translated into machine 
language and filed in the machine in any sequence. With the proper 
instructions the machine would print out any sequence the writer wished 
to try, freeing him from the necessity of keeping the ideas in his head.
 Mr. Nelson pointed out that we often do not think in linear sequences 
but rather in "swirls" and in footnotes. He introduced the concept of 
the hyper-text, which would be a more flexible, more generalized, 
non-linear presentation of material on a particular subject.<br>
		<br>
		The educational possibilities in the use of the hyper-text are vast. 
For example, it is possible that basic texts on a subject could be 
interindexed, so that the necessity and difficulty of tracing footnotes 
and rare sources would be eliminated. In this way the problems of 
information retrieval because of widespread writing today would be 
alleviated, making decisions in many fields easier.<br>
		<br>
		In conclusion Mr. Nelson re-emphasized the importance for humanists of
 learning to program. It is possible that scholarly controversies will 
be documented and that even off-the-cuff remarks by professors on a 
topic will be recorded. He indicated the excitement in the experiments 
regarding the nature of the written word.<br>
